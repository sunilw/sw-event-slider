# SW Events Slider

Takes our events and turns them into a slideshow.
This plugin relies on the presence of the plugin Events Calendar, produced by the folk at Modern Tribe.
This plugin is pretty minimal. It works and is provided on an as-is basis.
For support you can file issues on the github repo at this address: https://github.com/sunilw/sw-event-slider
I may also be available for hire. Contact me via email: sunil@sunil.co.nz

## Installation

The usual wordpress ways:
Strip out the git-related files, and upload the directory to wp-content/plugins.
At this time of writing I haven't bundled a zip file yet
